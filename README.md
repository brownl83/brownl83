I am a current senior at Oregon State University with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, or an entry-level Digital Forensics Analysis.
